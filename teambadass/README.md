# TeamBadass

This repository serves as the main hub for TeamBadass projects and collaboration.

## Quick Start

Start any new conversation by sharing this repository URL with Claude.

## Repository Structure

- **team/** - Team dynamics, communication, and methodology
- **projects/** - Individual project documentation and status
- **utils/** - Shared utilities and reusable components
- **_memory/** - System for maintaining continuity between conversations

## Active Projects

- **Furnace Project** - Documentation and mission control system for propane furnace
- **Memory System** - System for maintaining continuity between Claude conversations

## Memory System

The TeamBadass repository includes an automatic memory system that maintains continuity between conversations.

### Quick Start

1. Simply share this repository URL with Claude to activate the memory system
2. Use `Let's Hop` only when transitioning between projects
3. Use `check gas` to monitor Claude's processing capacity

### Memory Structure

- **_memory/system/** - Memory system components
- **_memory/core/** - Team dynamics and project history
- **_memory/projects/** - Project-specific memory

### Gas Gauge

Our system includes a visible gas gauge that tracks Claude's processing capacity:
- Appears automatically at session start
- Shows impact of loading context
- Helps manage request complexity
- Supports equitable work distribution

Use these commands to interact with the gas gauge:
- `check gas` - Display current gas level
- `estimate task [type] [complexity] [size]` - Check if Claude has enough capacity for a task

For more details, see [Memory System Documentation](_memory/system/readme.md)
