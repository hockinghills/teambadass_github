# Furnace Mission Control System

## Dashboard Approach
Transform the landing page into a dashboard showing key system metrics:
- Real-time temperature monitoring
- Gas and electric usage tracking
- System efficiency metrics
- Maintenance scheduling and alerts
- Failure state visualization

## System Flow Diagrams
Interactive diagrams showing how components connect and operate:
- Animated flows for different operational states
- Color-coded components based on status and temperature
- Click navigation to component documentation
- Visual indicators for maintenance needs
- Failure state visualization

## Alert System
Multi-level notification system for different states:
- Mobile push notifications for status changes
- Escalating alerts based on severity
- Emergency responder contact for critical failures
- Remote shutdown capabilities
- Comprehensive logging of all alerts and responses

## Hardware Integration
Physical sensor network feeding data to the system:
- Temperature sensors for various system parts
- Gas flow sensors
- Oxygen/air mixture sensors
- Pressure monitors
- Raspberry Pi 4 as central hub

## Testing Approach
Use existing smart home setup to prototype concepts:
- Sense monitor for power usage data
- TV and light control systems
- 3D printer enclosure temperature monitoring
- Raspberry Pi 4 for integration
