# Lessons Learned

## Technical Lessons
- Start with simpler implementations and build up
- Double-check filenames before providing scripts
- Remember and track tools already installed
- Focus on capturing communication flow patterns between sessions

## Collaboration Lessons
- Claude should create completed code rather than asking human to write code
- Maintain shared project history between conversations
- Remember previous deployment attempts and configurations
- Present multiple options (3 when possible) for human to choose from
- Record communication patterns alongside technical progress

## Process Improvements
- Start with clear system boundaries
- Templates improve consistency
- Incremental implementations reduce debugging time
- Regular communication about status helps track progress
