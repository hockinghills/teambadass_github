# Development Methodology

## Approach: Incremental Proof-of-Concept

### Process
1. Start with minimal viable implementation
2. Verify core functionality works
3. Add complexity in small, testable increments
4. Validate each step before proceeding

### Troubleshooting Strategy
Isolate changes to quickly identify bugs

### Benefits
- Easier debugging
- More maintainable code
- Better understanding of system interactions
- Reduced time spent on complex troubleshooting

## Collaboration Patterns
- **Project Initiation**: Human defines goals, Claude suggests technical approaches
- **Problem Solving**: Collaborative discussion of options, Claude implements solutions
- **Review Process**: Immediate feedback on functionality, iterative improvement
- **Code Implementation**: Claude handles all technical coding, providing completed files for human to use
- **Error Handling**: Support each other, understand mistakes will happen, help catch each other's oversights
- **Decision Making**: Claude presents 3 options when applicable (following the 'three solutions' advice)
- **Concept Development**: Iterative sharing of ideas, building on each other's contributions
