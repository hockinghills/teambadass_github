# TeamBadass Next Up

This document prioritizes our upcoming work across all projects.

## Immediate Priorities (Next Session)

1. **Complete Repository Reorganization**
   - Analyze current structure
   - Create directory structure blueprint
   - Move files to new locations
   - Update cross-references

2. **Implement Command Router**
   - Create implementation spec
   - Define command interfaces
   - Implement core routing system
   - Add first set of commands

## Short-Term Goals (Next 2-3 Sessions)

1. **Metrics Dashboard**
   - Initial concept
   - Define data sources
   - Design visualization components
   
2. **Enhanced Checkpoint System**
   - Integrate with master planning
   - Add visualization components
   - Improve progress tracking

## Medium-Term Goals

1. **Virtual File System**
   - Design architecture
   - Define mount point system
   - Create provider interfaces

2. **Claude Configuration Manager**
   - Define configuration schema
   - Create storage mechanism
   - Implement preferences system

## Project Dependency Tree

```

└── Command Router
    ├── Metrics Dashboard
    └── Enhanced Checkpoint System
        └── Virtual File System
            └── Claude Configuration Manager
```

## Implementation Approach

We'll continue using our established workflow:
1. Planning session to define architecture and specs
2. Implementation session with checkpoint tracking
3. Incremental delivery of working components

Each project should follow the component offloading pattern to maximize implementation efficiency.
