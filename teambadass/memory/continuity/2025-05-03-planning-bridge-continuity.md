# TeamBadass Planning-Checkpoint Integration Continuity
**Session Date: 2025-05-03**

## Current Status

We've developed a plan for a streamlined planning-checkpoint bridge to integrate our master planning list with the checkpoint system. The connectivity issues during the storm led us to simplify our approach for better resilience.

## Core Implementation Concept

The planning-bridge system will:
1. Load both master-list.json and master-planning.json checkpoints
2. Synchronize project status bidirectionally 
3. Support basic commands (SYNC, ADD-PROJECT, COMPLETE-PROJECT)
4. Work reliably even with spotty connectivity

## Implementation Files Planned

```
teambadass/_planning/
└── implementation/
    ├── planning-bridge.js     - Core implementation
    ├── planning-test.js       - Test functionality
    └── planning-cli.js        - Command interface
```

## Next Session Approach

For our next session, we'll:
1. Start with minimal context loading
2. Implement files one at a time, using the component offloading pattern
3. Write directly to the repository using MCP file operations
4. Test each component before moving to the next

## Gas Management Strategy

- Keep sessions lightweight with clear boundaries
- Implement one component per session if necessary
- Validate functionality after each implementation step
- Use direct file writes to offload mental capacity

## Command Reference

```
SYNC                        - Synchronize planning with checkpoints
STATUS                      - Show current planning status
ADD-PROJECT id "name" desc  - Add a new project
COMPLETE-PROJECT id         - Mark a project as completed
```

This streamlined approach will let us make steady progress despite connectivity challenges. Each component will be self-contained and functional, making the system resilient to session interruptions.
