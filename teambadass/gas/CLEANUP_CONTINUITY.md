# Gas System Cleanup Continuity Document

## Current Progress
- ✅ Created new minimal-tracker.py with streamlined implementation
- ✅ Updated README.md with clear documentation
- ✅ Started file cleanup process
- ✅ Removed consolidated_gas_gauge.py
- ✅ Removed dashboard.tsx

## Interrupted Task
We were in the process of removing redundant files:
- ✅ consolidated_gas_gauge.py (moved to tmp_backup)
- ✅ dashboard.tsx (moved to tmp_backup)
- ⏸️ gas_gauge_core.py (pending)
- ⏸️ gauge_reporting.py (pending)
- ⏸️ operation-tracking-model.js (pending)

## Next Steps
1. **Complete File Removal**:
   ```
   gas_gauge_core.py → tmp_backup/
   gauge_reporting.py → tmp_backup/
   operation-tracking-model.js → tmp_backup/
   ```

2. **Update Import References**:
   - Check auto-init.js for old references
   - Update memory/gas-tracker.js if needed
   - Verify memory/init.py for dependencies

3. **Verify Implementation**:
   - Test minimal-tracker.py functionality
   - Ensure no broken references

4. **Cleanup Temporary Directory**:
   - Remove tmp_backup after verification

## Implementation Approach
Using file system operations through the MCP functions to directly manage files:
```python
# Move pattern we're using
move_file(source="/path/to/old/file.py", destination="/path/to/tmp_backup/file.py")
```
