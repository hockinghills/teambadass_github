## Usage Instructions

1. **Recording Operations**:
   - Add each significant operation to the tracking table
   - Estimate usage based on complexity and size
   - Update cumulative usage and status

2. **Detecting Warning Indicators**:
   - When "long chats" warning appears, record the cumulative usage
   - If session ends unexpectedly, record last known usage
   - Note if six-hour limit is encountered

3. **Adjusting Thresholds**:
   - After each session, calculate the weighted average of observed thresholds
   - Update thresholds for the next session
   - Record patterns in threshold variations

4. **Task Planning**:
   - Use pre-task assessments for all significant tasks
   - Record decision options presented
   - Note which option was selected and the outcome
