# Session Notes: 2025-04-29

## Topics Covered
- Google Drive vs. GitHub implementation comparison
- Memory system consolidation planning
- Comprehensive checklist creation for next session
- Workflow for ongoing continuity maintenance
- Division of responsibilities between Claude and human

## Decisions Made
- Discontinue all Google Drive integration components
- Keep core memory system, gas gauge, and keystone moment functionality
- Focus on GitHub-based workflow for continuity
- Create a comprehensive checklist for next session

## Action Items
- [x] Create detailed consolidation checklist
- [x] Update project history JSON with latest session
- [x] Document workflow for ongoing continuity
- [ ] In next session: Begin implementing the checklist tasks
- [ ] In next session: Review each component for valuable functionality

## Next Steps
- Start implementing the consolidation checklist systematically
- Focus first on core memory system components
- Remove Google Drive dependencies throughout the codebase
- Begin furnace documentation planning

## Notes
- The furnace is now operational at glass-blowing temperatures (~2000Â°F)
- Future work will include both furnace documentation and a dashboard
- Artifacts should always have production filenames for easier implementation
- Current gas system in GitHub is solid and doesn't need replacement from older implementation
